VPC (virtual private cloud)
  logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS Cloud
  You can specify an IP address range for the VPC, add subnets, associate security groups, and configure route tables

subnet
  range of ip addresses in your vpc

A default VPC has the benefits of the advanced features provided by EC2-VPC, and is ready for you to use. If you have a default VPC and don't specify a subnet when you launch an instance, the instance is launched into your default VPC

Your default VPC includes an internet gateway, and each default subnet is a public subnet

An internet gateway enables your instances to connect to the internet through the Amazon EC2 network edge

You can enable internet access for an instance launched into a nondefault subnet by attaching an internet gateway to its VPC

NAT (network address translation)
  allows an instance in your VPC to initiate outbound connections to the internet but prevent unsolicited inbound connections from the internet

  A NAT device has an Elastic IP address and is connected to the internet through an internet gateway

  You can connect an instance in a private subnet to the internet through the NAT device, which routes traffic from the instance to the internet gateway, and routes any responses to the instance.
