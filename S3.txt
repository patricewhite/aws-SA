        To disable object-level logging for the bucket, you must go to the CloudTrail console and remove the bucket name from the trail's Data events.
    Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic - A web service that coordinates and manages the delivery or sending of messages to subscribing endpoints or clients
        Logs API calls
    Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue – Offers reliable and scalable hosted queues for storing messages as they travel between computer.
    Lambda function – AWS Lambda is a compute service where you can upload your code and the service can run the code on your behalf using the AWS infrastructure.
    The maximum size of a file that you can upload by using the Amazon S3 console is 78 GB
    folder name is prefix for uploaded files
        If you upload individual files and you have a folder open in the Amazon S3 console, when Amazon S3 uploads the files, it includes the name of the open folder as the prefix of the key names
    metadata starting with prefix x-amz-meta- is treated as user-defined metadata
    To undelete an object, you must delete the delete marker
    CloudWatch
        monitors metrics
    Server Access Logging
        provides detailed records for the requests that are made to a bucket.
        You must grant the Log Delivery group write permission on the target bucket by adding a grant entry in the bucket's access control list (ACL).
    Mananging Access
        Access policies you attach to your resources (buckets and objects) are referred to as resource-based policies
            bucket policies
                You want to manage cross-account permissions for all Amazon S3 permissions 
            access control lists (ACLs)
                object acl 
                    If the AWS account that owns the object also owns the bucket, then it can write a bucket policy to manage the object permissions
                    If the AWS account that owns the object wants to grant permission to a user in its account, it can use a user policy.
                    An object ACL is the only way to manage access to objects not owned by the bucket owner
                bucket acl 
                    grant write permission to the Amazon S3 Log Delivery group to write access log objects to your bucket
            user policy
                Permission from the parent account
                Permission from the resource owner
        To perform a specific operation on a resource, an IAM user needs permission from both the parent AWS account to which it belongs and the AWS account that owns the resource.
        User context – In the user context, the parent account to which the user belongs is the context authority.
        Bucket context – In the bucket context, Amazon S3 evaluates policies owned by the AWS account that owns the bucket.
        Object context – If the request is for an object, Amazon S3 evaluates the subset of policies owned by the object owner.

    Objects 
        pre-signed object urls 
            owner can optionally share objects with others by creating a pre-signed URL, using their own security credentials, to grant time-limited permission to download the objects.
            you must provide your security credentials, specify a bucket name, an object key, specify the HTTP method (GET to download the object) and expiration date and time
            The pre-signed URLs are valid only for the specified duration.
            Anyone who receives the pre-signed URL can then access the object.
        Multipart Upload 
            three-step process
                initiate the upload
                    When you send a request to initiate a multipart upload, Amazon S3 returns a response with an upload ID, which is a unique identifier for your multipart upload. You must include this upload ID whenever you upload parts, list the parts, complete an upload, or abort an upload.
                upload the object parts
                    When uploading a part, in addition to the upload ID, you must specify a part number
                after you have uploaded all the parts, you complete the multipart upload
            part sizes range from 5 MB to 5 GB, last part can be < 5 MB
    API
        Delete
            The DELETE operation removes the null version (if there is one) of an object and inserts a delete marker, which becomes the current version of the object.
            If there isn't a null version, Amazon S3 does not remove any objects.
